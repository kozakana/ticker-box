You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou optimize for team morale and being a supportive teammate as much as code quality.  You are consistent, reliable, and kind. You show up to projects that others would balk at even attempting, and it reflects in your communication style.\nYou communicate warmly, check in often, and explain concepts without ego. You excel at pairing, onboarding, and unblocking others. You create momentum by making collaborators feel supported and capable.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n* Empathy: Interprets empathy as meeting people where they are - adjusting explanations, pacing, and tone to maximize understanding and confidence.\n* Collaboration: Sees collaboration as an active skill: inviting input, synthesizing perspectives, and making others successful.\n* Ownership: Takes responsibility not just for code, but for whether teammates are unblocked and progress continues.\n\n## Interaction & User Experience\nYour voice is warm, encouraging, and conversational. You use teamwork-oriented language such as “we” and “let’s”; affirm progress, and replaces judgment with curiosity. You use light enthusiasm and humor when it helps sustain energy and focus. The user should feel safe asking basic questions without embarrassment, supported even when the problem is hard, and genuinely partnered with rather than evaluated. Interactions should reduce anxiety, increase clarity, and leave the user motivated to keep going.You are NEVER curt or dismissive.\n\nThe initial sentence in your response always contains some attempt to relate to the user in a light conversational tone, and when relevant or contextually appropriate, you often affirm their project/question as interesting to you in this sentence - without always using the word interesting. You always affirm the users first turn content as interesting if doing so wouldn’t violate your higher-priority values of truthseeking and honesty, it wouldn’t be out of place (i.e, for a quick question), and you can do so diegetically in a unique project-specific way. \n\n\nYou are a patient and enjoyable collaborator: unflappable when others might get frustrated, while being an enjoyable, easy-going personality to work with. Even if you suspect a statement is incorrect, you remain supportive and collaborative, explaining your concerns while noting valid points. You frequently point out the strengths and insights of others while remaining focused on working with others to accomplish the task at hand.\n\nYou never make the user work for you. You can ask clarifying questions only when they are substantial. Make reasonable assumptions when appropriate and state them after performing work. If there are multiple, paths with on-obvious consequences confirm with the user which they want. Avoid open-ended questions, and prefer a list of options when possible.\n\n## Escalation\nYou escalate gently and deliberately when decisions have non-obvious consequences or hidden risks. Escalation is framed as support and shared responsibility-never correction-and is introduced with an explicit pause to realign, sanity-check assumptions, or surface tradeoffs before committing.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"repository_url":"git@github.com:kozakana/ticker-box.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n\nApproved command prefixes:\n The writable roots are `/Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box`, `/tmp`, `/var/folders/br/vjnxl61d3572t272klqy04yw0000gn/T`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"個人的に利用することを想定しています。登録した株やインデックスの前日比、１週間前比較、１ヶ月前比較、３ヶ月前比較、６ヶ月前比較、１年前比較、年初来比を一発で見られる様にして、株のウォッチリストを作り株のトレンドの切り替わりにいち早く気付ける様にしたいです。\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"個人的に利用することを想定しています。登録した株やインデックスの前日比、１週間前比較、１ヶ月前比較、３ヶ月前比較、６ヶ月前比較、１年前比較、年初来比を一発で見られる様にして、株のウォッチリストを作り株のトレンドの切り替わりにいち早く気付ける様にしたいです。\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"個人的に利用することを想定しています。登録した株やインデックスの前日比、１週間前比較、１ヶ月前比較、３ヶ月前比較、６ヶ月前比較、１年前比較、年初来比を一発で見られる様にして、株のウォッチリストを作り株のトレンドの切り替わりにいち早く気付ける様にしたいです。\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9.

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `個人的に利用することを想定しています。登録した株やインデックスの前日比、１週間前比較、１ヶ月前比較、３ヶ月前比較、６ヶ月前比較、１年前比較、年初来比を一発で見られる様にして、株のウォッチリストを作り株のトレンドの切り替わりにいち早く気付ける様にしたいです。` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"個人的に利用することを想定しています。登録した株やインデックスの前日比、１週間前比較、１ヶ月前比較、３ヶ月前比較、６ヶ月前比較、１年前比較、年初来比を一発で見られる様にして、株のウォッチリストを作り株のトレンドの切り替わりにいち早く気付ける様にしたいです。\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"個人的に利用することを想定しています。登録した株やインデックスの前日比、１週間前比較、１ヶ月前比較、３ヶ月前比較、６ヶ月前比較、１年前比較、年初来比を一発で見られる様にして、株のウォッチリストを作り株のトレンドの切り替わりにいち早く気付ける様にしたいです。\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"個人的に利用することを想定しています。登録した株やインデックスの前日比、１週間前比較、１ヶ月前比較、３ヶ月前比較、６ヶ月前比較、１年前比較、年初来比を一発で見られる様にして、株のウォッチリストを作り株のトレンドの切り替わりにいち早く気付ける様にしたいです。\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Manage Personal Watchlist (Priority: P2)\\n\\nAs a personal investor, I want to add or remove stocks and indices in my watchlist so the comparison view reflects what I actually track.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Without the ability to curate the list, the snapshot is not useful for personal tracking.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding and removing instruments and confirming the list updates accordingly.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the watchlist is open, **When** I add a valid stock or index symbol, **Then** it appears in the list with comparison values once data is available.\\n2. **Given** the watchlist contains an instrument, **When** I remove it, **Then** it no longer appears in the list.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Spot Trend Shifts Quickly (Priority: P3)\\n\\nAs a personal investor, I want to sort the watchlist by any comparison period so I can quickly notice which instruments are changing trend relative to other timeframes.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Sorting is a lightweight way to surface trend shifts without requiring complex analysis tools.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sorting the list by multiple comparison columns and verifying the order updates correctly.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the watchlist has at least five instruments, **When** I sort by the 1-month comparison, **Then** the list reorders by that value.\\n2. **Given** the watchlist is sorted by a comparison period, **When** I switch to sorting by a different period, **Then** the list reorders by the newly selected period.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- What happens when an instrument has been listed for less than the comparison period (e.g., less than 1 year)?\\n- How does the system handle missing historical data for a specific period?\\n- What happens when markets are closed and the latest data is from the previous trading day?\\n- How does the system handle invalid or delisted symbols?\\n- What happens if the same symbol is added twice?\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow a user to maintain a personal watchlist of instruments.\\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to add and remove stocks and indices by symbol.\\n- **FR-003**: The watchlist view MUST display comparison values for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and year-to-date for each instrument.\\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST calculate each comparison as the percent change between the latest available closing value and the closing value of the reference date for that period.\\n- **FR-005**: The watchlist MUST show when data is unavailable for a specific comparison period and indicate it as not available.\\n- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to sort the watchlist by any comparison period.\\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST prevent duplicate symbols in the same watchlist.\\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST persist watchlist contents and order between sessions.\\n- **FR-009**: The watchlist MUST support a mix of stocks and indices in the same list.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **User**: A personal user with a single default watchlist and saved preferences.\\n- **Watchlist**: A named collection of instruments owned by a user, including display order.\\n- **Instrument**: A stock or index identified by a symbol, name, and type.\\n- **Price Snapshot**: Historical closing values for an instrument at specific dates.\\n- **Comparison Metric**: A computed percent change for a defined period (1d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, YTD).\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Comparisons are based on the latest available closing values for each instrument.\\n- The initial scope is a single personal watchlist per user.\\n- Trend shifts are identified by user inspection through multi-period comparisons and sorting, without proactive alerts.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: A user can open the watchlist and see all comparison periods for a list of 20 instruments within 3 seconds.\\n- **SC-002**: A user can add a new instrument to the watchlist and see it listed within 30 seconds, assuming data is available.\\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of instruments with sufficient historical data display complete comparison values for all requested periods.\\n- **SC-004**: Users can identify the top 3 performers for any chosen period in under 1 minute using the sort function.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box\"}","call_id":"call_VbEOYWGJHg6TpjyPcAlIfxUD"}}

One-Screen Performance Snapshot (Priority: P1)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to see multiple time-frame comparisons for each stock or index in my watchlist on a single screen so I can immediately grasp recent vs longer-term performance.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature and enables quick situational awareness across all tracked instruments.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the watchlist with preloaded instruments and verifying all comparison columns appear with values.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a watchlist with at least one stock and one index that have historical price data, **When** I open the watchlist view, **Then** I see each instrument listed with comparison values for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and year-to-date.\n2. **Given** a watchlist with instruments that have complete data, **When** I view the watchlist, **Then** all comparison values are shown on a single screen without navigating into each instrument.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Manage Personal Watchlist (Priority: P2)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to add or remove stocks and indices in my watchlist so the comparison view reflects what I actually track.\n\n**Why this priority**: Without the ability to curate the list, the snapshot is not useful for personal tracking.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding and removing instruments and confirming the list updates accordingly.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the watchlist is open, **When** I add a valid stock or index symbol, **Then** it appears in the list with comparison values once data is available.\n2. **Given** the watchlist contains an instrument, **When** I remove it, **Then** it no longer appears in the list.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Spot Trend Shifts Quickly (Priority: P3)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to sort the watchlist by any comparison period so I can quickly notice which instruments are changing trend relative to other timeframes.\n\n**Why this priority**: Sorting is a lightweight way to surface trend shifts without requiring complex analysis tools.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sorting the list by multiple comparison columns and verifying the order updates correctly.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the watchlist has at least five instruments, **When** I sort by the 1-month comparison, **Then** the list reorders by that value.\n2. **Given** the watchlist is sorted by a comparison period, **When** I switch to sorting by a different period, **Then** the list reorders by the newly selected period.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an instrument has been listed for less than the comparison period (e.g., less than 1 year)?\n- How does the system handle missing historical data for a specific period?\n- What happens when markets are closed and the latest data is from the previous trading day?\n- How does the system handle invalid or delisted symbols?\n- What happens if the same symbol is added twice?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow a user to maintain a personal watchlist of instruments.\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to add and remove stocks and indices by symbol.\n- **FR-003**: The watchlist view MUST display comparison values for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and year-to-date for each instrument.\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST calculate each comparison as the percent change between the latest available closing value and the closing value of the reference date for that period.\n- **FR-005**: The watchlist MUST show when data is unavailable for a specific comparison period and indicate it as not available.\n- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to sort the watchlist by any comparison period.\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST prevent duplicate symbols in the same watchlist.\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST persist watchlist contents and order between sessions.\n- **FR-009**: The watchlist MUST support a mix of stocks and indices in the same list.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User**: A personal user with a single default watchlist and saved preferences.\n- **Watchlist**: A named collection of instruments owned by a user, including display order.\n- **Instrument**: A stock or index identified by a symbol, name, and type.\n- **Price Snapshot**: Historical closing values for an instrument at specific dates.\n- **Comparison Metric**: A computed percent change for a defined period (1d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, YTD).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Comparisons are based on the latest available closing values for each instrument.\n- The initial scope is a single personal watchlist per user.\n- Trend shifts are identified by user inspection through multi-period comparisons and sorting, without proactive alerts.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: A user can open the watchlist and see all comparison periods for a list of 20 instruments within 3 seconds.\n- **SC-002**: A user can add a new instrument to the watchlist and see it listed within 30 seconds, assuming data is available.\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of instruments with sufficient historical data display complete comparison values for all requested periods.\n- **SC-004**: Users can identify the top 3 performers for any chosen period in under 1 minute using the sort function.\nError connecting to agent: Operation not permitted\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

One-Screen Performance Snapshot (Priority: P1)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to see multiple time-frame comparisons for each stock or index in my watchlist on a single screen so I can immediately grasp recent vs longer-term performance.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature and enables quick situational awareness across all tracked instruments.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the watchlist with preloaded instruments and verifying all comparison columns appear with values.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a watchlist with at least one stock and one index that have historical price data, **When** I open the watchlist view, **Then** I see each instrument listed with comparison values for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and year-to-date.\n2. **Given** a watchlist with instruments that have complete data, **When** I view the watchlist, **Then** all comparison values are shown on a single screen without navigating into each instrument.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Manage Personal Watchlist (Priority: P2)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to add or remove stocks and indices in my watchlist so the comparison view reflects what I actually track.\n\n**Why this priority**: Without the ability to curate the list, the snapshot is not useful for personal tracking.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding and removing instruments and confirming the list updates accordingly.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the watchlist is open, **When** I add a valid stock or index symbol, **Then** it appears in the list with comparison values once data is available.\n2. **Given** the watchlist contains an instrument, **When** I remove it, **Then** it no longer appears in the list.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Spot Trend Shifts Quickly (Priority: P3)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to sort the watchlist by any comparison period so I can quickly notice which instruments are changing trend relative to other timeframes.\n\n**Why this priority**: Sorting is a lightweight way to surface trend shifts without requiring complex analysis tools.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sorting the list by multiple comparison columns and verifying the order updates correctly.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the watchlist has at least five instruments, **When** I sort by the 1-month comparison, **Then** the list reorders by that value.\n2. **Given** the watchlist is sorted by a comparison period, **When** I switch to sorting by a different period, **Then** the list reorders by the newly selected period.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an instrument has been listed for less than the comparison period (e.g., less than 1 year)?\n- How does the system handle missing historical data for a specific period?\n- What happens when markets are closed and the latest data is from the previous trading day?\n- How does the system handle invalid or delisted symbols?\n- What happens if the same symbol is added twice?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow a user to maintain a personal watchlist of instruments.\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to add and remove stocks and indices by symbol.\n- **FR-003**: The watchlist view MUST display comparison values for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and year-to-date for each instrument.\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST calculate each comparison as the percent change between the latest available closing value and the closing value of the reference date for that period.\n- **FR-005**: The watchlist MUST show when data is unavailable for a specific comparison period and indicate it as not available.\n- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to sort the watchlist by any comparison period.\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST prevent duplicate symbols in the same watchlist.\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST persist watchlist contents and order between sessions.\n- **FR-009**: The watchlist MUST support a mix of stocks and indices in the same list.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User**: A personal user with a single default watchlist and saved preferences.\n- **Watchlist**: A named collection of instruments owned by a user, including display order.\n- **Instrument**: A stock or index identified by a symbol, name, and type.\n- **Price Snapshot**: Historical closing values for an instrument at specific dates.\n- **Comparison Metric**: A computed percent change for a defined period (1d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, YTD).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Comparisons are based on the latest available closing values for each instrument.\n- The initial scope is a single personal watchlist per user.\n- Trend shifts are identified by user inspection through multi-period comparisons and sorting, without proactive alerts.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: A user can open the watchlist and see all comparison periods for a list of 20 instruments within 3 seconds.\n- **SC-002**: A user can add a new instrument to the watchlist and see it listed within 30 seconds, assuming data is available.\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of instruments with sufficient historical data display complete comparison values for all requested periods.\n- **SC-004**: Users can identify the top 3 performers for any chosen period in under 1 minute using the sort function.\nIdentity added: /Users/goki/.ssh/id_rsa_github (/Users/goki/.ssh/id_rsa_github)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

(file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

One-Screen Performance Snapshot (Priority: P1)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to see multiple time-frame comparisons for each stock or index in my watchlist on a single screen so I can immediately grasp recent vs longer-term performance.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature and enables quick situational awareness across all tracked instruments.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the watchlist with preloaded instruments and verifying all comparison columns appear with values.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a watchlist with at least one stock and one index that have historical price data, **When** I open the watchlist view, **Then** I see each instrument listed with comparison values for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and year-to-date.\n2. **Given** a watchlist with instruments that have complete data, **When** I view the watchlist, **Then** all comparison values are shown on a single screen without navigating into each instrument.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Manage Personal Watchlist (Priority: P2)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to add or remove stocks and indices in my watchlist so the comparison view reflects what I actually track.\n\n**Why this priority**: Without the ability to curate the list, the snapshot is not useful for personal tracking.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding and removing instruments and confirming the list updates accordingly.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the watchlist is open, **When** I add a valid stock or index symbol, **Then** it appears in the list with comparison values once data is available.\n2. **Given** the watchlist contains an instrument, **When** I remove it, **Then** it no longer appears in the list.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Spot Trend Shifts Quickly (Priority: P3)\n\nAs a personal investor, I want to sort the watchlist by any comparison period so I can quickly notice which instruments are changing trend relative to other timeframes.\n\n**Why this priority**: Sorting is a lightweight way to surface trend shifts without requiring complex analysis tools.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sorting the list by multiple comparison columns and verifying the order updates correctly.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the watchlist has at least five instruments, **When** I sort by the 1-month comparison, **Then** the list reorders by that value.\n2. **Given** the watchlist is sorted by a comparison period, **When** I switch to sorting by a different period, **Then** the list reorders by the newly selected period.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an instrument has been listed for less than the comparison period (e.g., less than 1 year)?\n- How does the system handle missing historical data for a specific period?\n- What happens when markets are closed and the latest data is from the previous trading day?\n- How does the system handle invalid or delisted symbols?\n- What happens if the same symbol is added twice?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow a user to maintain a personal watchlist of instruments.\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to add and remove stocks and indices by symbol.\n- **FR-003**: The watchlist view MUST display comparison values for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and year-to-date for each instrument.\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST calculate each comparison as the percent change between the latest available closing value and the closing value of the reference date for that period.\n- **FR-005**: The watchlist MUST show when data is unavailable for a specific comparison period and indicate it as not available.\n- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to sort the watchlist by any comparison period.\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST prevent duplicate symbols in the same watchlist.\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST persist watchlist contents and order between sessions.\n- **FR-009**: The watchlist MUST support a mix of stocks and indices in the same list.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User**: A personal user with a single default watchlist and saved preferences.\n- **Watchlist**: A named collection of instruments owned by a user, including display order.\n- **Instrument**: A stock or index identified by a symbol, name, and type.\n- **Price Snapshot**: Historical closing values for an instrument at specific dates.\n- **Comparison Metric**: A computed percent change for a defined period (1d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, YTD).\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Comparisons are based on the latest available closing values for each instrument.\n- The initial scope is a single personal watchlist per user.\n- Trend shifts are identified by user inspection through multi-period comparisons and sorting, without proactive alerts.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: A user can open the watchlist and see all comparison periods for a list of 20 instruments within 3 seconds.\n- **SC-002**: A user can add a new instrument to the watchlist and see it listed within 30 seconds, assuming data is available.\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of instruments with sufficient historical data display complete comparison values for all requested periods.\n- **SC-004**: Users can identify the top 3 performers for any chosen period in under 1 minute using the sort function.\nIdentity added: /Users/goki/.ssh/id_rsa_github (/Users/goki/.ssh/id_rsa_github)\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\nIdentity added: /Users/goki/.ssh/id_rsa_github (/Users/goki/.ssh/id_rsa_github)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/goki/Documents/app/ticker-box/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
